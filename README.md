# Arduino-Based-Health-Monitoring-System

It is an Arduino-based health monitoring system that measures and displays key health metrics including SpO2 (oxygen saturation), BPM (beats per minute), and body temperature. This project is ideal for DIY enthusiasts and students looking to explore health monitoring technologies using Arduino.

## Features
- Measures SpO2 levels using a pulse oximeter sensor.
- Monitors heart rate (BPM).
- Measures body temperature using a Dallas temperature sensor.
- Displays the collected data on an LCD screen.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor  
- Dallas Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Resistors
